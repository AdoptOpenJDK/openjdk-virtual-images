openjdk-virtual-images
======================

Virtual Images and the infrastructure that builds them for the Adopt OpenJDK programme.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-virtual-images/wiki) for Documentation!

# Current Progress
Progress to date is that we have a valid packer.io template set which can create a VirtualBox image as well as a base box that can be manipulated by Vagrant for OpenJDK development. 

After that we'll provide multiple _Vagrantfile_ configurations for folks with different host machine capabilities.

Finally, Murali et al will tighten up the whole process using Puppet and other devops pro techniques.

The documentation in the wiki allows you to follow current progress.
